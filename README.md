# HandPoseClassificationDemo

This is the demo application for Hand Pose Classification template of CreateML.

From macOS 12+, we can choose `Hand Pose Classification` template in CreateML.
This application demonstrates how to use mlmodel from it on actual application.

This application has `MyHandPoseClassifier.mlmodel` build from `Hand Pose Classification` template. It can only recognize whether hand pose is `OkSign` or `NotOkSign`.

But you can replace it by your custom model from same template.
Please refer following tutorial for creating your own mlmodel.
